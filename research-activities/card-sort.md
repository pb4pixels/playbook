# Card sorts

**Things you'll need:** Index cards, post-it notes, pens, a large table, 3-5 participants per group, 3-5 groups, a private room 

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

## Best to use when

Card sorts are a good way to figure out how information or transactions should be organised so that most users will understand where to find things.

## Types of card sort

In theory there are three types of card sorts:

1. **Open card sorts** are free form. Participants write types of information or actions on cards. This should be focused on what they need to do to complete an action related to the service. They then group these cards and title the groupings. These card sorts are harder to run but give us insights into semantics as well as categorisation.
2. **Closed card sorts** have restricted number of cards with a single peice of information or action *already* written on each. Participants read the cards and group them with one card as the title for each group. These card sorts enable us to compare categorisation of the same words. 
3. **Priority card sorts**: Participants order cards according to how important they are. These card sorts allow use to understand what scales people are using to measure importance as well as which things are most important to them.

In practice you will probably use a combination of these card sorts

## How to run a card sort

1. *Before the day* Invite and cofirm a range of (potential) users 
2. *On the day* Introductions (and ice breakers)
3. Expectations setting of what the activity will involve and a high level explantion of how card sorts are helpful
4. Arrange participants into a few mixed groups of 3-5 participants
3. Ask partipants to read or write on the cards. It should be one thing on each card, represented by no more than five words
4. Rotate round the groups; observing each one and asking them to explain their understanding of cards at regular intervals
2. Ask the participants to group the cards and give each group a name
3. Rotate round the groups; identify the cards that get more discussion over others. Encourage discussion in each group. Think about which cards are contentious? why does it belong or not to a group? Why does this group have this heading? What does it mean?
4. Ask participants to rank the groups in order of priority
5. Rotate round the groups : identify which cards are important and which cards are not. Encourage the groups to question themselves and justify the position of cards at either end of the scale.
6. Optional: Each group to present to everyone
5. At the end of the session ask if anyone has any comments or reflections they would like to share
6. Thank participants and tell them how this card sort will help the development of this digital service and what they can expect to happen next

## Remember

1. Encourage debate
2. Let the participants lead the dicussion
3. Everyone has a voice
4. Leave with an understanding of why particpants have categorised the way they have
